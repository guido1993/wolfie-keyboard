# Wolfie Keyboard

This is a Windows Phone 8.0 app meant to bring Wolfram Alpha (www.wolframalpha.com) functionalities on Windows Phone.
The app went live early 2014 and retired 2 years later from the Store following direct "kind, unmotivated complains" from WolframAlpha LLC itself, right after their official app went live.

It totalized roughly 100k downloads, overall.

The app has been featured in a variety of articles on blogs and websites:
